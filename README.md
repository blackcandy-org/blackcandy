Black Candy is a self-hosted music streaming server, your personal music center. 

## Try The Demo

Please visit <https://demo.blackcandy.org> and use demo user (email: admin@admin.com, password: foobar) to log in. And feel free to try it.

> [!NOTE]
> This demo user does not have administrator privileges. So you cannot experience all the features in Black Candy. And all music in the demo are from [Free Music Archive](https://freemusicarchive.org/). You can check their [licenses](https://github.com/blackcandy-org/blackcandy/blob/master/docs/demo_music_licenses.md).

## Installation

Black Candy uses docker image to install easily. You can run Black Candy like this.

```shell
docker run -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/blackcandy-org/blackcandy:latest 

# Or pull from Docker Hub.
docker run -p 3000:3000 blackcandy/blackcandy:latest 
```

That's all. Now, you can access either http://localhost:3000 or http://host-ip:3000 in a browser, and use initial admin user to log in (email: admin@admin.com, password: foobar).

## Upgrade

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> If you upgrade to a major version, you need to read the upgrade guide carefully before upgrade. Because there are some breaking changes in a major version.
> 
> - See [V3 Upgrade](https://github.com/blackcandy-org/blackcandy/blob/master/docs/v3_upgrade.md) for upgrade from V2 release.
> - See [Edge Upgrade](https://github.com/blackcandy-org/blackcandy/blob/master/docs/edge_upgrade.md) for upgrade from edge release to latest stable release.

Upgrade Black Candy is pull new image from remote. Then remove an old container and create a new one.

```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/blackcandy-org/blackcandy:latest
docker stop <your_blackcandy_container>
docker rm <your_blackcandy_container>
docker run <OPTIONS> ghcr.io/blackcandy-org/blackcandy:latest 
```

With docker compose, you can upgrade Black Candy like this:

```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/blackcandy-org/blackcandy:latest
docker-compose down
docker-compose up
```

For Android app, you can also download APK from [GitHub Release](https://github.com/blackcandy-org/android/releases/latest)

## Configuration

### Port Mapping

Black Candy exports the 3000 port. If you want to be able to access it from the host, you can use the `-p` option to map the port. 

```shell
docker run -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/blackcandy-org/blackcandy:latest
```

### Media Files Mounts 

You can mount media files from host to container and use `MEDIA_PATH` environment variable to set the media path for black candy.

```shell
docker run -v /media_data:/media_data -e MEDIA_PATH=/media_data ghcr.io/blackcandy-org/blackcandy:latest   
```

### Use PostgreSQL As Database

Black Candy use SQLite as database by default. Because SQLite can simplify the process of installation, and it's an ideal choice for self-hosted small server. If you think SQLite is not enough, or you are using some cloud service like heroku to host Black Candy, you can also use PostgreSQL as database.

```shell
docker run -e DB_ADAPTER=postgresql -e DB_URL=postgresql://yourdatabaseurl ghcr.io/blackcandy-org/blackcandy:latest 
```

### How to Persist Data

All the data that need to persist in Black Candy are stored in `/app/storage`, So you can mount this directory to host to persist data.

```shell
mkdir storage_data

docker run -v ./storage_data:/app/storage ghcr.io/blackcandy-org/blackcandy:latest 
```

### Nginx To Send File

Black Candy supports use Nginx to delivery audio file to the client. It's a more effective way than handled by Black Candy backend. And Black Candy docker image is also ready for [nginx-proxy](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy), which means you can set up a Nginx proxy for Black Candy easily.

You can use docker-compose to set up those services. The docker-compose.yml file looks like this:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  nginx-proxy:
    image: nginxproxy/nginx-proxy
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./blackcandy.local:/etc/nginx/vhost.d/blackcandy.local:ro
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro
      - /media_data:/media_data # Keep the path of media files in container the same as blackcandy container.

  app:
    image: ghcr.io/blackcandy-org/blackcandy:latest 
    volumes:
      - ./storage_data:/app/storage
      - /media_data:/media_data
    environment:
      VIRTUAL_HOST: blackcandy.local
      MEDIA_PATH: /media_data
      NGINX_SENDFILE: "true" # Don't forget to set `NGINX_SENDFILE` environment variable to true to enable nginx sendfile.
```

```shell
# Get the default sendfile config for blackcandy. This file need to mount to nginx proxy container to add custom configuration for nginx.
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blackcandy-org/blackcandy/v3.0.0/config/nginx/sendfile.conf > blackcandy.local

docker-compose up
```

### Logging

Black Candy logs to `STDOUT` by default. So if you want to control the log, Docker already supports a lot of options to handle the log in the container. See: https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/configure/.

## Environment Variables

| Name                         | Default   | Description |
| ---                          | ---       | ---         |
| DB_URL                 |           | The URL of PostgreSQL database. You must set this environment variable if you use PostgreSQL as database. |
| MEDIA_PATH                   |           | You can use this environment variable to set media path for Black Candy, otherwise you can set media path in settings page. |
| DB_ADAPTER             | "sqlite"  | There are two adapters are supported, "sqlite" and "postgresql".|
| NGINX_SENDFILE               | false     | Whether enable Nginx sendfile. |
| SECRET_KEY_BASE              |           | When the SECRET_KEY_BASE environment variable is not set, Black candy will generate SECRET_KEY_BASE environment variable every time when service start up. This will cause old sessions invalid, You can set your own SECRET_KEY_BASE environment variable on docker service to avoid it. |
| FORCE_SSL                    | false     | Force all access to the app over SSL. |
| DEMO_MODE                    | false     | Whether to enable demo mode, when demo mode is on, all users cannot access administrator privileges, even user is admin. And also users cannot change their profile.  |

## Edge Version

The edge version of Black Candy base on master branch, which means it's not stable, you may encounter data loss or other issues. However, I don't recommend normal user using an edge version. But if you are a developer who wants to test or contribute to Black Candy, you can use the edge version.

```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/blackcandy-org/blackcandy:edge
```

## Development
